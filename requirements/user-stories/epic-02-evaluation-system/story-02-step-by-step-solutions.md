## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Addition Problem Solution

```gherkin
Given the question "27 + 15 = ?"
When I view the step-by-step solution
Then I should see:
"Step 1: Line up the numbers by place value
  27
+ 15
____

Step 2: Add the ones column: 7 + 5 = 12
Write 2, carry 1 to tens column

Step 3: Add the tens column: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4

Step 4: The answer is 42"
```

### Scenario 2: Word Problem Solution

```gherkin
Given the word problem "Sarah has 18 stickers. She gives 5 to her brother. How many stickers does she have left?"
When I view the solution steps
Then I should see:
"Step 1: Identify what we know
- Sarah starts with 18 stickers
- She gives away 5 stickers

Step 2: Identify what we need to find
- How many stickers Sarah has left

Step 3: Choose the operation
- This is a subtraction problem: 18 - 5

Step 4: Solve
18 - 5 = 13

Step 5: Answer in context
Sarah has 13 stickers left"
```
