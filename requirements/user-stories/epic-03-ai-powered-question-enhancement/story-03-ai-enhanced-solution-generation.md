# User Story: AI-Enhanced Solution Generation

**Story ID:** US-AI-003  
**Epic:** AI-Powered Question Enhancement (EP-QG-003)  
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Sprint:** Sprint 2 (Days 6-8)  
**Dependencies:** US-AI-002 (LangChain/Ollama Core Integration) - IN PROGRESS

## User Story

```
As a student learning math
I want AI-generated step-by-step explanations that adapt to my grade level
So that I understand the reasoning behind each solution
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] **AC-001:** When I get a wrong answer, the AI provides age-appropriate explanations for Grade 3 level
- [ ] **AC-002:** AI generates multiple explanation styles (visual, verbal, step-by-step) based on learning preferences
- [ ] **AC-003:** Solution complexity automatically adapts to my grade level and comprehension
- [ ] **AC-004:** AI explanations include encouraging language and positive reinforcement
- [ ] **AC-005:** System validates educational appropriateness of all AI-generated explanations
- [ ] **AC-006:** Explanations maintain consistency with NZ Mathematics Curriculum teaching methods

### Technical Requirements

- **REQ-SOL-001:** Extend LangChain pipeline with solution generation chain
- **REQ-SOL-002:** Create grade-level vocabulary and complexity adaptation
- **REQ-SOL-003:** Implement multiple explanation format templates
- **REQ-SOL-004:** Add educational appropriateness validation
- **REQ-SOL-005:** Integrate with existing MathQuestion solution steps
- **REQ-SOL-006:** Performance optimization for real-time explanation generation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] AI generates grade-appropriate explanations for all question types
- [ ] Multiple explanation styles functional (visual, verbal, step-by-step)
- [ ] Educational validation ensures content appropriateness
- [ ] Explanation generation completes within 2 seconds
- [ ] Integration with existing question generation pipeline
- [ ] A/B testing framework ready for explanation effectiveness
- [ ] Unit tests cover explanation generation logic
- [ ] Parent feedback mechanism operational

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Solution Generation Pipeline

```typescript
interface SolutionGenerationChain {
  inputAnalyzer: QuestionAnalyzer;
  explanationStyleSelector: ExplanationStyleSelector;
  gradeAdapter: GradeLevelAdapter;
  vocabularyController: VocabularyController;
  validationEngine: EducationalValidator;
}

interface ExplanationStyle {
  VISUAL: 'visual'; // Uses diagrams, counting aids
  VERBAL: 'verbal'; // Conversational explanation
  STEP_BY_STEP: 'steps'; // Procedural breakdown
  STORY: 'story'; // Narrative-based explanation
}
```

### Grade-Level Adaptation

```typescript
class GradeLevelAdapter {
  adaptExplanation(solution: string, grade: DifficultyLevel): string {
    switch (grade) {
      case DifficultyLevel.GRADE_3:
        return this.adaptForGrade3(solution);
      // Future grades...
    }
  }

  private adaptForGrade3(solution: string): string {
    // Use simple vocabulary (1-2 syllable words)
    // Include counting aids and visual references
    // Keep sentences short (5-8 words)
    // Use encouraging, positive language
  }
}
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Grade-Appropriate Explanation Generation

```gherkin
Given a Grade 3 student answers "15 + 7 = 20" (incorrect)
When the AI generates an explanation
Then it should use Grade 3 appropriate vocabulary
And include visual counting aids ("count on your fingers")
And use encouraging language ("Let's try together!")
And provide clear step-by-step guidance
And the explanation should be validated as educationally appropriate
```

### Scenario 2: Multiple Explanation Styles

```gherkin
Given a student needs help with "12 + 8 = ?"
When different explanation styles are requested
Then visual style should include counting references
And verbal style should use conversational tone
And step-by-step should break down the process
And all styles should maintain Grade 3 vocabulary level
```
