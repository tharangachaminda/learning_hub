   - Mitigation: Model optimization, async processing, intelligent caching

3. **Resource Constraints**
   - Risk: Local LLM consumes excessive system resources
   - Mitigation: Resource monitoring, model quantization, graceful degradation

### Educational Risks

1. **Curriculum Misalignment**

   - Risk: AI generates off-topic or inappropriate content
   - Mitigation: Curriculum validation layer, expert review process
