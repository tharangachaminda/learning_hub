# User Story: Ollama LLM Integration

**Story ID:** US-SI-002  
**Epic:** System Integration  
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Sprint:** Sprint 1 (Days 1-4)

## User Story

```
As a developer
I want to integrate Ollama with llama3.1 model for question generation
So that the platform can generate math questions locally without internet
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

-   [ ] **AC-001:** Ollama service runs locally and responds to API calls within 3 seconds
-   [ ] **AC-002:** llama3.1 model generates Grade 3 appropriate math questions
-   [ ] **AC-003:** Generated questions are mathematically correct and educationally sound
-   [ ] **AC-004:** System handles Ollama service failures gracefully with fallback options
-   [ ] **AC-005:** Question generation includes proper formatting for different question types
-   [ ] **AC-006:** Model responses are consistent and reproducible for similar prompts

### Technical Requirements

-   **REQ-SI-011:** Integrate Ollama REST API for local LLM question generation
-   **REQ-SI-012:** Configure llama3.1 model for educational content generation
-   **REQ-SI-013:** Implement LangChain integration for prompt management and response parsing

## Definition of Done

-   [ ] Ollama service installed and configured with llama3.1 model
-   [ ] REST API integration tested and documented
-   [ ] Question generation prompts optimized for Grade 3 mathematics
-   [ ] Error handling covers all Ollama failure scenarios
-   [ ] Performance benchmarks meet 3-second response requirement
-   [ ] Integration tests verify mathematical accuracy of generated content

## Dependencies

-   Ollama installation with sufficient hardware resources
-   llama3.1 model download and configuration
-   LangChain library setup for prompt management

## Technical Implementation Notes

-   Install Ollama with recommended system requirements (8GB+ RAM)
-   Configure llama3.1 model with education-specific prompts
-   Implement retry logic and timeout handling for API calls
-   Create prompt templates for different math operation types

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Question Generation

```gherkin
Given Ollama is running with llama3.1 model
When I request 5 Grade 3 addition questions
Then I should receive 5 unique addition problems
And each question should be mathematically correct
And difficulty should be appropriate for Grade 3 level
And response should be received within 3 seconds
```

### Scenario 2: Question Format Consistency

```gherkin
Given I request multiple choice questions about subtraction
When Ollama generates the questions
Then each question should have exactly 4 answer options
And one correct answer with three plausible distractors
And consistent formatting across all generated questions
And proper mathematical notation where needed
```

### Scenario 3: Error Handling

```gherkin
Given Ollama service becomes temporarily unavailable
When the system tries to generate questions
Then I should receive a clear error message
And the system should retry the request 3 times
And fallback to cached questions if available
And user should be notified of offline mode gracefully
```

## Success Metrics

-   Question generation success rate >99.5%
-   Average response time <2 seconds for 10 questions
-   Mathematical accuracy of generated questions 100%
-   Zero service crashes during 24-hour continuous operation

## Notes

-   Monitor system resource usage during question generation
-   Plan for model updates and version management
-   Consider question quality validation before presenting to students
