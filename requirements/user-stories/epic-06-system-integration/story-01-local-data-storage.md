# User Story: Local Data Storage

**Story ID:** US-SI-001  
**Epic:** System Integration  
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Sprint:** Sprint 1 (Days 1-4)

## User Story

```
As a system administrator
I want all student data to be stored locally on the device
So that the platform works offline and protects student privacy
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

-   [ ] **AC-001:** All student progress data saves to local device storage (MongoDB local)
-   [ ] **AC-002:** Question generation works without internet connection using local LLM
-   [ ] **AC-003:** Platform functions fully in offline mode for practice sessions
-   [ ] **AC-004:** Data syncs with cloud backup when internet connection is available
-   [ ] **AC-005:** Parents can export local data to CSV or PDF for records
-   [ ] **AC-006:** System gracefully handles storage quota limitations

### Technical Requirements

-   **REQ-SI-007:** Implement local-first architecture with offline capabilities
-   **REQ-SI-008:** Set up MongoDB local instance for student data persistence
-   **REQ-SI-009:** Configure Ollama for offline LLM operation
-   **REQ-SI-010:** Create data export functionality in multiple formats

## Definition of Done

-   [ ] MongoDB local instance configured and tested
-   [ ] All student data persists locally without network dependency
-   [ ] Offline mode tested for 24+ hour usage without issues
-   [ ] Data export generates valid CSV and PDF files
-   [ ] Storage monitoring prevents data loss from quota limits
-   [ ] Performance benchmarks met for local storage operations

## Dependencies

-   MongoDB installation and configuration
-   Ollama LLM setup for local operation
-   File system access permissions for data storage

## Technical Implementation Notes

-   Configure MongoDB with local-only access
-   Implement local storage management with cleanup policies
-   Create offline detection and mode switching logic
-   Set up background sync processes for when online

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Offline Operation

```gherkin
Given the device has no internet connection
When a student opens the math practice app
Then they should be able to generate new questions
And answer questions with immediate feedback
And progress should be tracked and saved locally
And all features should work without network errors
```

### Scenario 2: Data Persistence

```gherkin
Given a student completes 10 questions and earns a badge
When the app is closed and reopened later
Then all progress data should be preserved
And the badge should still be visible
And question history should be maintained
And no data should be lost between sessions
```

### Scenario 3: Data Export

```gherkin
Given a parent wants to export their child's progress
When they select "Export Data" from settings
Then they should receive a CSV file with all practice sessions
And a PDF report with progress summary and achievements
And export should complete within 30 seconds
And files should be readable by standard applications
```

## Success Metrics

-   100% data persistence across app restarts
-   Offline mode works for >48 hours continuous usage
-   Data export success rate >99%
-   Local storage operations complete <500ms
-   Zero data loss incidents during testing

## Notes

-   Prioritize data integrity over performance optimizations
-   Plan for device storage limitations (tablets with 16GB storage)
-   Consider GDPR compliance for local data handling
