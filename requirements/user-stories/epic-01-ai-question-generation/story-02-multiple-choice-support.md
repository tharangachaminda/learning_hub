**Priority:** P0 (Critical)  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Sprint:** Sprint 1 (Days 1-4)

## User Story

```
As a Grade 3 student
I want to answer multiple choice math questions
So that I can practice problem-solving with guided options
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

-   [ ] **AC-001:** When I receive a math question, I see 4 multiple choice options (A, B, C, D)
-   [ ] **AC-002:** Only one option is correct, three are plausible distractors
-   [ ] **AC-003:** I can click/tap to select my answer
-   [ ] **AC-004:** Correct answer is highlighted in green after submission
-   [ ] **AC-005:** Incorrect options show in red with correct answer explanation
-   [ ] **AC-006:** Each MCQ includes detailed solution explanation

### Technical Requirements

-   **REQ-QG-002:** Support question types: MCQ, fill-in-blank, drag-drop, word problems
-   **REQ-QG-006:** Generate plausible incorrect answers (distractors) for MCQ questions
-   **REQ-QG-007:** Ensure correct answer placement is randomized (not always option A)

## Definition of Done

-   [ ] MCQ questions generate with 4 options (1 correct, 3 distractors)
-   [ ] Answer placement is randomized across A, B, C, D
-   [ ] Distractors are mathematically plausible but incorrect
-   [ ] Selection UI is touch/click friendly
-   [ ] Answer feedback is immediate and clear
-   [ ] Unit tests verify MCQ generation logic

## Dependencies

-   Basic question generation (US-QG-001)
-   Frontend answer selection component
-   Answer validation service

## Technical Implementation Notes

-   Generate distractors using common mathematical errors
-   Implement random answer position shuffling
-   Create answer validation logic with immediate feedback
-   Design responsive UI for answer selection

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: MCQ Answer Selection

```gherkin
Given I have a Grade 3 addition MCQ "What is 15 + 8?"
When I view the question
Then I should see 4 answer options: A) 21, B) 23, C) 25, D) 24
And I can select one option
And the correct answer position is randomized
```

### Scenario 2: Answer Feedback

```gherkin
Given I selected answer B) 23 for "15 + 8 = ?"
When I submit my answer
Then I should see my selection highlighted in green (correct)
And receive explanation: "15 + 8 = 23. Adding the ones: 5 + 8 = 13. Write 3, carry 1. Adding tens: 1 + 0 + 1 = 2. Answer is 23."
```

## Success Metrics

-   MCQ questions have exactly 4 options
-   Answer position distribution is roughly equal across A, B, C, D
-   Distractors are pedagogically appropriate (common errors)
-   Answer selection success rate > 95%

## Notes

-   Focus on common mathematical misconceptions for distractors
-   Ensure UI accessibility for young learners
-   Consider color-blind friendly feedback colors
