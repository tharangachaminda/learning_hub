**Story ID:** US-QG-001  
**Epic:** AI-Powered Question Generation  
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Sprint:** Sprint 1 (Days 1-4)

## User Story

```
As a Grade 3 student
I want the system to generate math problems appropriate for my level
So that I can practice addition and subtraction at the right difficulty
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

-   [ ] **AC-001:** When I select "Grade 3 - Addition", the system generates 10 unique addition problems
-   [ ] **AC-002:** Questions range from single-digit (3+5) to double-digit (15+7) appropriate for Grade 3
-   [ ] **AC-003:** Each question includes a step-by-step solution explanation
-   [ ] **AC-004:** Question generation completes within 3 seconds
-   [ ] **AC-005:** All questions align with NZ Curriculum Level 2-3 standards
-   [ ] **AC-006:** Questions are mathematically correct and age-appropriate
-   [ ] **AC-007:** System supports basic operations: addition, subtraction for MVP

### Technical Requirements

-   **REQ-QG-001:** Generate mathematics questions across 5 difficulty levels (Grade 2-8)
-   **REQ-QG-002:** Support question types: MCQ, fill-in-blank, drag-drop, word problems
-   **REQ-QG-003:** Align questions with New Zealand Mathematics Curriculum (Phase 1)
-   **REQ-QG-004:** Generate 10+ unique questions per topic/subtopic combination
-   **REQ-QG-005:** Include detailed solution explanations for each generated question

## Definition of Done

-   [ ] AI generates 10 unique questions per topic in <3 seconds
-   [ ] Questions align with NZ Curriculum Level 2-3
-   [ ] Basic solution explanations included
-   [ ] Unit tests cover question generation logic
-   [ ] Integration tests verify Ollama LLM connection
-   [ ] Performance tests confirm 3-second requirement

## Dependencies

-   Ollama setup and configuration (llama3.1 model)
-   LangChain integration for prompt management
-   Basic database schema for question storage

## Technical Implementation Notes

-   Use Ollama REST API with llama3.1 model
-   Implement LangChain prompt templates for math generation
-   Create question validation logic for curriculum alignment
-   Set up MongoDB schema for question metadata storage

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Grade 3 Addition Questions

```gherkin
Given I am a Grade 3 student
When I select "Grade 3 - Numbers - Addition"
Then I should receive 10 unique addition problems
And each question should include step-by-step solution
And questions should range from basic (single-digit) to advanced (multi-digit)
And all questions should align with NZ Curriculum Level 2-3 standards
```

### Scenario 2: Performance Requirements

```gherkin
Given the system is ready to generate questions
When I request Grade 3 addition problems
Then the generation should complete within 3 seconds
And all 10 questions should be mathematically correct
```

## Success Metrics

-   Question generation latency < 3 seconds
-   100% mathematical accuracy for generated questions
-   10 unique questions per topic/grade combination
-   Curriculum alignment validated by education specialist

## Notes

-   Focus on basic arithmetic operations for MVP
-   Ensure questions are culturally appropriate for NZ context
-   Consider different learning styles in question presentation
