-   Set up automated accessibility testing

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Question Display

```gherkin
Given I open a math question
When the page loads
Then I should see the question in large, clear text
And answer options are displayed as big, colorful buttons
And a "Help" button is visible in the top corner
And the page layout fits properly on my tablet screen
```

### Scenario 2: Touch Interaction

```gherkin
Given I see multiple choice answers A, B, C, D
When I tap answer "B"
Then the button should highlight immediately
And I should feel haptic feedback (on supported devices)
And a "Submit Answer" button should appear
And I can change my selection before submitting
```

### Scenario 3: Accessibility Support

```gherkin
Given I am using a screen reader
When I navigate the math question page
Then the question is read aloud clearly
And answer options are announced properly
And I can navigate using keyboard only
And focus indicators are clearly visible
```

## Success Metrics

-   Task completion rate >95% for Grade 3 students
-   Average time to answer first question <30 seconds
-   Accessibility compliance score 100% for WCAG 2.1 AA
-   User satisfaction rating >4.5/5 from student testing

## Notes

-   Prioritize simplicity over feature richness for MVP
-   Consider dyslexia-friendly fonts (OpenDyslexic alternative)
-   Test on actual devices used in NZ primary schools
