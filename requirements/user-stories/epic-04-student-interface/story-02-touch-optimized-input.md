# User Story: Touch-Optimized Answer Input

**Story ID:** US-SI-002  
**Epic:** Student Interface  
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Sprint:** Sprint 2 (Days 5-8)

## User Story

```
As a Grade 3 student using a tablet
I want to easily input my answers by touching the screen
So that I can answer math questions quickly and naturally
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

-   [ ] **AC-001:** I can tap number buttons to enter my answer in a large input field
-   [ ] **AC-002:** Virtual number keypad appears automatically for numeric answers
-   [ ] **AC-003:** I can easily correct mistakes with a large "Delete" button
-   [ ] **AC-004:** Multiple choice answers are large buttons I can tap confidently
-   [ ] **AC-005:** Drag-and-drop interactions work smoothly for ordering problems
-   [ ] **AC-006:** Visual feedback shows when I've successfully selected/entered an answer

### Technical Requirements

-   **REQ-SI-003:** Support touch interactions with gesture-friendly UI components
-   **REQ-SI-005:** Implement custom virtual keyboard for mathematical input
-   **REQ-SI-006:** Enable drag-and-drop functionality for interactive problem types

## Definition of Done

-   [ ] All answer input methods work reliably on touch devices
-   [ ] Virtual keyboard appears and dismisses appropriately
-   [ ] Touch targets meet minimum 44px accessibility requirements
-   [ ] Drag-and-drop interactions are smooth and responsive
-   [ ] Input validation prevents invalid entries
-   [ ] Performance testing on older tablets shows acceptable response times

## Dependencies

-   Child-friendly interface foundation (US-SI-001)
-   Basic answer evaluation system (US-EV-001)
-   Touch device testing environment

## Technical Implementation Notes

-   Implement custom virtual number pad with large buttons
-   Use HTML5 drag-and-drop API with touch event polyfills
-   Create touch-optimized input validation
-   Add haptic feedback for supported devices

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Numeric Answer Entry

```gherkin
Given I see the question "25 + 13 = ?"
When I tap the answer input field
Then a large number keypad should appear
And I can tap "3", "8" to enter "38"
And I can tap "Delete" to correct to "38"
And the "Submit" button becomes active when I have an answer
```

### Scenario 2: Multiple Choice Selection

```gherkin
Given I see a multiple choice question with options A, B, C, D
When I tap option "B"
Then option B should highlight with a blue border
And other options should remain unhighlighted
And I can tap a different option to change my selection
And the "Submit" button becomes active
```

### Scenario 3: Drag-and-Drop Ordering

```gherkin
Given I see a question "Put these numbers in order: 15, 8, 23, 12"
When I drag "8" to the first position
Then the number should move smoothly with my finger
And drop into the correct position with visual feedback
And other numbers should adjust their positions
And I can rearrange all numbers before submitting
```

## Success Metrics

-   Touch input success rate >98% on target devices
-   Average answer entry time <15 seconds for Grade 3 students
-   Drag-and-drop completion rate >95%
-   Zero critical touch interaction bugs in production

## Notes

-   Test on various tablet sizes (7", 10", 12")
-   Consider left-handed users in interface design
-   Implement appropriate haptic feedback where available
