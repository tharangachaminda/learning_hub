Then I should see "Achievement Unlocked!" popup
And "First Steps" badge appears with animation
And the badge is added to my collection
And encouraging sound effect plays
```

### Scenario 2: Streak Achievement

```gherkin
Given I have practiced math for 6 consecutive days
When I complete at least 5 questions on day 7
Then I should unlock "Week Warrior" badge
And see special streak celebration
And my current streak count updates to 7 days
```

### Scenario 3: Badge Collection View

```gherkin
Given I have earned 3 badges: "First Steps", "Addition Master", "Week Warrior"
When I open my badge collection
