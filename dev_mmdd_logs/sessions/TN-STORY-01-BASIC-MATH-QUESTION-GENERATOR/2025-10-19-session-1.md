- [x] Micro-step plan created and approved

## Micro-Step Implementation Plan (Approved)

### Phase 1: Core Entity (Steps 4-6)

1. **RED**: Create MathQuestion entity test (5 mins) - **CURRENT**
2. **GREEN**: Implement minimal MathQuestion class (10 mins)
3. **REFACTOR**: Add TSDoc and improve structure (5 mins)

### Phase 2: Basic Generation (Steps 7-9)

4. **RED**: Write failing test for simple addition generation (10 mins)
5. **GREEN**: Implement basic addition generator (15 mins)
6. **REFACTOR**: Extract generation logic and improve (10 mins)

### Architecture Components

- **MathQuestion Entity**: Data structure (question, answer, solution, difficulty)
- **MathQuestionGenerator Service**: Core generation logic
- **DifficultyLevel**: Grade 3 configuration
- **Operation Types**: Addition/subtraction enums

## Session Results Summary

### ✅ Completed Implementation
